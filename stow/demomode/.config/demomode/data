The future is here, now what?
You are watching the internet.
Nobody is Happy.
If you are reading this then you are too late.
I can't remember what I was so angry about.
I'm sorry if I keep on trying to forget.
I can't tonight. I'm going online.
In my dreams you actually care.
No one is bothered.
It's kicking off everywhere.
I suppose this is just the way things are.
Trying to stay human in a world full of animals.
If you are having fun, you are not learning.
Friends who want to stay friends don't talk about politics or religion.
It will end in tears.
It is happening again.
The world isn't working.
We are all going to die.
Welcome to the struggle.
Let's stay in bed.
Disappointed, but not surprised.
Please hold on.
This is the end.
Everything is going to be okay.
OK.
This was home.
Don't care.
Do not fear the future.
Try to not think about it.
Keep looking.
It didn't.
Welcome home.
I'm not used to people sticking around.
Heaven can wait.
Be a better person (x4).
Do I dare disturb the universe?
Take me (I'm yours).
yes yes yes yes.
You are exactly where you need to be.
Don't forget me.
Please don't.
I can't stop thinking about you.
The end.
I saw galaxies in your eyes.
No matter how good you are, you can always be replaced.
You are beautiful.
Your brain is a bedroom.
Do not trust atoms, they make up everything.
We wanted to be the sky.
It's good to be kind.
What if you get sick of me?
What's stopping you?
I just think we should be together all the time.
Slogans in nice typefaces won't save the human species. 
How is it going to end?
This is a profound waste of time.
Everything is recorded.
Nothing is permanent.
Why is being alive so expensive?
I am not enjoying this.
Sometimes, your computer just says no. 
Protect me from what I want.
Soon I will be done. 
I opened my purse and there was nothing. 
You just need to consolidate your data.
None of us are okay. 
Is this the end?
I will go mad when you do.
Can you help me relax please?
Politics is broken.
I work best when I am under extreme stress.
It's okay to talk to yourself. 
We are not all in this together.
Quit your job. 
Another world is possible. 
We are in this together. 
I should not be here.
it's all an illusion.
Surfing on the Information Superhighway.
We can't move forward if you're stuck in the past.
I have given up.
Cunts are still running the world. 
This is the new normal.
Nothing will change.
